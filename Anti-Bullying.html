    <h2>What is Bullying?</h2>
    <p>Bullying is when someone hurts, threatens, or controls another person on purpose, often more than once, by using their power such as strength, popularity, or words to cause harm. It can be physical, like hitting or pushing, verbal, like teasing or name-calling, social, like leaving someone out, or online through cyberbullying.</p>

    <h2>How to Prevent It</h2>
    <p>To stop bullying before it happens, we need to create a safe and respectful environment where everyone feels included and valued. This means teaching kindness and empathy, setting clear rules about behaviour, encouraging people to speak up, and making sure schools, families, and communities work together to support positive actions.</p>

    <h2>How You Can Help</h2>
    <p>If you see or know someone being bullied, you can make a difference by standing up for them safely, refusing to join in, offering them friendship, and reporting the situation to a trusted adult or teacher. Small actions, like including someone who feels left out or choosing kind words, can help stop bullying and show others that it is never acceptable.</p>
